Notes on [this article](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-python-guide/curriculum/class-01/notes/pain_suffering) on pain and suffering

## Pain vs Suffering

**Pain is:**

- Any growth will cause pain -- especially when learning a new skill
- 401 tests a students skills in:
    - Research
    - Problem Solving (with minimal help)
    - Emotional Resilience
    - Collaboration
    - Working Outside One's Comfort Zone
    - Dealing With Uncertainty
    - Dealing With Physical Exhaustion

All of these are common obstacles when learning and growing but should not be confused with suffering

**Suffering is: pain without a purpose or goal and depends on perspective**

Think about these things to gain perspective:

1. Whatâ€™s your perspective?

2. Why are you doing this?

3. Do you want what comes at the end of this journey?

4. Are you doing this for you?

___________

Bottomline:  Remember the end goal
