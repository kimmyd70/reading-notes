# Intro to Django

notes for [getting started](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/)

Django is an object-relational mapper

You can use the built-in dynamic API access or write SQL if needed

Django has a clean, elegant URL scheme; your `URLconf` Python module maps between URL patterns and your views

Django uses templates with html

Django has a powerful forms library or you can generate forms from your existing models

Django has built in secure authentication that handles accounts, groups, permissions, and cookie-based sessions

Django has an automatic admin interface that reads metadata in your models to give content producers what they need to start managing content

Django provides language translation as well as locale-specific formatting for dates, times, number, and time zones
