# Images in HTML and CSS (pp. 94-124)

### I'm very familiar with image manipulations from web design courses 
+ Use `<img>` with a `src`
+ Use alt text for accessibility
+ Save images in the correct size and format
    - use JPEG for photo
    - use PNG for transparency (or possibly transparent GIF)
    - use animated GIF for illustration only
        - better to use animation
+ Use `<figcaption>` with `<figure>` wrap to contain both caption and image
+ Set sizes using pixels
+ Use vector when appropriate
