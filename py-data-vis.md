- pyplot provides a convenient interface to the matplotlib object-oriented plotting library. It is modeled closely after Matlab(TM). Therefore, the majority of plotting commands in pyplot have Matlab(TM) analogs with similar arguments. Important commands are explained with interactive examples.

The tutorial has these subtopics. I will not rehash the tutorial workings here.  Much better to open the tutorial and extend their process to a specific implementation
