# Javascript makes the action happen

HTML is the content layer; CSS is the presentation layer; Javascript is the behavior layer forming **progressive enhancement**

Remember the Construction Company website we coded with js

js in conditional statements that returned a greeting

declared the variables and conditions in a .js

called it with **script** in body of the html

our first instance of document.write function

runs where it is found in the html

step-by-step series of statements 

**case sensitive** yellowHouse; See p 69 for variable naming rules

use comments (//)

declare variable and assign value (same statement or separately)

understand how the different types of variable interact (string, numeric, boolean)

Remember = vs == vs === (assigned, equal to, strictly equal)
