## Risk Analysis
notes from [this article](https://www.edureka.co/blog/risk-analysis-in-software-testing/)

The probability of any unwanted incident is defined as Risk. In Software Testing: 
- risks are identified
- risks are prioritized for testing
- level of risk is assigned to each
- each risk is categorized
- the impact of each risk is calculated

A list of risks to consider:
1. Use of new hardware
2. Use of new technology
3. Use of new automation tool
4. The sequence of code
5. Availability of test resources 

### ** Categories:

!!! High: means the effect of the risk would be very high and intolerable. The company might face loss.

!! Medium: it is tolerable but not desirable. The company may suffer financially but there is a limited risk.

! Low: it is tolerable with little or no external exposure or no financial loss.

### ** Risk Identification

1. Business Risks: This risk is the most common risk and may come from your company or your customer, not from your project.

2. Testing Risks

3. Premature Release Risk

4. Software Risks

### ** Risk Assessment
Should be looked at programatically/systemically:

Effect – determine its impact

Cause – Scan the problem and reach to the point that could be the most probable reason behind the error/unintended behavior

Likelihood – the probability that a risk will occur or a requirement won’t be satisfied
