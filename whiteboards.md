## Whiteboard Tips and Advice


and [this one](https://blog.usejournal.com/6-tips-to-ace-a-whiteboard-programming-interview-f06c1b378bc6)

So, 6 tips (or 7 as given in title and body of the article??)

1.  Instead, wait until the interviewer is done explaining the problem. Ask any clarifying questions, and then tell your interviewer:
>“Okay, got it. If it’s okay with you, I’m just going to take a minute or two here and think about the problem, and then I’ll start talking.”

2.  Write down the steps of the solution.

3.  Write pseudocode first.

4.  Don’t sweat the small stuff.
>If you can’t remember something like this, it’s often acceptable to say that you’d look it up.


>“…and here, I’d use whatever the list.contains() equivalent is in JavaScript. I know it’s not contains, but I can’t remember the method name right now, so we’ll call it contains() for now and I’d look it up right now if I were coding this.”

5.  Sit down. Be humble.
A programming interview isn’t just a written exam. It’s an assessment of your programming abilities, and there are plenty of things that fall into that category beyond mere coding prowess. For example:
- Are you able to express your ideas and solutions clearly and effectively?
Do you treat the interviewer with respect?
- How do you accept criticism (technical, constructive or otherwise)?
- Are you able to collaborate with others to come up with solutions?
- Do you communicate in a way that demonstrates empathy?
- Are you honest (especially about yourself)?

6.  Come prepared.I recommend the same personal interview prep bible: Cracking the Coding Interview, by Gail Laakman McDowell.

7.  Review your work for:
- Algorithm efficiency
- Correctness
- Edge Cases

Communicate! Keep things conversational


1. First, Restate the Question
2. Ask About Edge Cases
3. Ask About Test Cases
4.  Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense
5. Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good
6. Stuck? Ask for Help! (conversationally--“I’m a bit stuck here, do you have any tips to nudge me in the right direction?”
)
