# Text part 2 (pp. 264-299)

### I'm VERY familiar with text manipulation from my web design classes

+ Properties to control
    - Font family
    - Font size
    - Weight
    - Style
    - Spacing

+ Assume people have limited fonts installed--use backup designations if you pick a lesser used font

+ Control Spacing:
    - kerning, tracking, and leading as in typography

+ Remember `hover`, `active`, and `focus` states
