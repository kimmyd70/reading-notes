## Read and Write Python Files

notes from [this article](https://realpython.com/read-write-files-python/)

A file is a **continguous** block of bytes used to store data that contains:

1. Header: metadata about the contents of the file (file name, size, type, and so on)
2. Data: contents of the file as written by the creator or editor
3. End of file (EOF): special character that indicates the end of the file

The extension usually gives clue to what type of data is stored (.jpg, .txt, etc)

A file path is needed to access the data:

1. Folder Path: the file folder location on the file system where subsequent folders are separated by a forward slash / (Unix) or backslash \ (Windows)
2. File Name: the actual name of the file
3. Extension: the end of the file path pre-pended with a period (.) used to indicate the file type
