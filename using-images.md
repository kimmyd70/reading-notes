+ You can set up classes for various helper CSS blocks

+ Consider adding `float` to helper classes
+ For **center** alignment, wrap image in `<p>` and `text-align` in CSS; left and right `margin` set to **auto**
+ Use background images with `repeat`; use `background-attachment` with`fixed` or `scroll`; use `background-position`

+ Shorthand: `background: (color)(img URL)(repeat)(attachment)(position)`

+ Use **rollover** and **sprites** for magical hover state for static, hover, and on-click changes (not for touchscreen) pp. 417-418 (also saves processing accessing only one image)
