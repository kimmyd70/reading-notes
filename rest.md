Roy Fielding: first to figure out protocols (HTTP) for request/response

The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.

A web page is a “representation” of a resource. Resources are just concepts. URLs point to the concepts

Extended machine-to-machine from intra-office to anywhere in the world.

Makes heavy use of re-directs

Makes use of poylymorphism: some verbs are almost universal like GET, PUT, and DELETE.

Ideally, every URL would have a human readable and a machine readable representation. When a machine GETs the resource, it will ask for the machine readable one. When a browser GETs a resource for a human, it will ask for the human readable one.
