I will come back to all the articles listed, but you can see my notes below for the two I chose to focus on:


## Ethics in the workplace
[The code I’m still ashamed of](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e/)

This one is enticing simply because of the title, so I read it.  My thoughts:

When I read the title of this article, I was expecting to read about a developer who didn't say no to an assignment that wasn't politically correct, wasn't inclusive, or something of that nature.  We spent quite a bit of time in my Graphic Design curriculum discussing how to balance a well-paying job or a job that would launch our reputation/business with just how far we'd stray from our beliefs to get that paycheck or business boost.  In theory, we all agreed that there is a line we wouldn't cross and each of us has to personally determine where that line is.  I really liked this article because the author discusses being uncomfortable with the project as he was working on it, and being ashamed once he realized the true results and ramifications of the completed project.  This one stuck with me because his project seems benign on the surface and I can see many junior developers wrestling with whether to speak up or not once the ramifications of a project like this are unmasked.

The first quote of the article is scary, but itneeds to be noted and evaluated with each project a dev agrees to:
>"If you write code for a living, there’s a chance that at some point in your career, someone will ask you to code something a little deceitful – if not outright unethical."

## Ethics in Technology

[Big Data is our Civil Rights issue](http://solveforinteresting.com/big-data-is-our-generations-civil-rights-issue-and-we-dont-know-it/)

[Will democracy survive big data and AI?](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/will-democracy-survive-big-data-and-artificial-intelligence/)

I am always interested Scientifc American magazine because of their reputation, and this article is no exception.  The crux of the article is summed up at the beginning 
>"...soon we will not only have smart phones, but also smart homes, smart factories and smart cities. Should we also expect these developments to result in smart nations and a smarter planet?"  

The article proposes Singapore as "a perfect example of a data-controlled society. What started as a program to protect its citizens from terrorism has ended up influencing economic and immigration policy, the property market and school curricula." The article speaks of how Western society is using technology in a less obvious/transparent way to "nudge" populations toward political agendas and points out that nudging is a modern form of paternalism.  I'm not an alarmist when it comes to politics (the last 4 years presidental term being the exception), but I did key on this article's premise that nudging with technology can be subtle, effective, and have long-reaching consequences.  Every time my older parents start with "I read on Facebook...." I cringe because I know that their "news" feed has been tailored to support their currently-held views and rarely gives them the alternative perspective.
